      <p3>Ending Notes:</p3>
      <p class="ending__notes"> Thank you for taking the time to read my resume. I spent a great deal of time and effort making sure that 
        it was completed correctly, and also was satisfactory to my artistic vision, which is vitally important to me. I have never touched HTML or CSS before, so I hope the
        quality of my resume will demonstrate the exact fire that I will bring to Prime. Thank you for your time.
