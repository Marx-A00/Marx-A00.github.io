Welcome to my *first* complete post using /ox-hugo/!

** Introduction
This is a subheading that will be converted to an H2 in Hugo.

#+begin_src python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello from ox-hugo!")
#+end_src

** Conclusion
Org mode is powerful for writing blog posts!

Thanks for checking out my little slice of the internet. If you're seeing this it either means:

1. I just made this, so it's close to March 17th 2025
2. I never updated this, in that case R.I.P 
3. You scrolled all the way back to my first post o_0

Either way, I anticipate posts on here being sporadic and random, revolving around any number of topics, but probably related to art, tech, or Emacs. Stay tuned and feel free to reach out!
